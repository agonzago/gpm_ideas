Okay, here's a summary of the current situation, the bug, and relevant information to start fresh:

Goal:
Successfully run Bayesian estimation for a DSGE model using Numpyro. The model is parsed from a .dyn file, system matrices are derived symbolically once and lambdified for JAX (using dynare_parser_engine.py), and the likelihood is computed via a custom JAX-based Kalman filter (Kalman_filter_jax.py).

Current Status & Successes:

Parsing and Lambdification: The dynare_parser_engine.py correctly parses the .dyn file, handles auxiliary variables, orders equations/variables, performs symbolic differentiation, and creates JAX-compatible lambdified functions for the system matrices (A, B, C, D for stationary; P, Q for trends; Omega for observation).

Model Solution with Concrete Parameters: The DynareModelWithLambdified.solve() method successfully uses these lambdified functions to compute numerical system matrices and solve the model (using a JAX-based SDA solver) when provided with concrete parameter values. The SDA solver converges quickly (e.g., 7 iterations) for these concrete cases.

Kalman Filter: The KalmanFilter class in Kalman_filter_jax.py works correctly and computes a reasonable log-likelihood when its inputs (system matrices T, R, C, H) are well-behaved.

Log-Likelihood Consistency (for Concrete Parameters): The DynareModelWithLambdified.log_likelihood() method, when tested with concrete initial parameter values (e.g., in test_kalman_integration), now correctly calls model.solve(), gets valid system matrices, calls the KalmanFilter, and returns a log-likelihood value that matches a direct call to the Kalman filter. This confirms the lax.cond structure within log_likelihood is working as intended for these specific concrete inputs.

MCMC Speed Improvement: Reducing max_iter in the SDA solver (e.g., to 30) significantly sped up MCMC iterations when it was running (before the current "Cannot find valid initial parameters" error).

The Core Bug:

The MCMC estimation fails during initialization with the error:
RuntimeError: Cannot find valid initial parameters. Please check your model again.

Root Cause of the Bug (Strong Hypothesis):

This error occurs because Numpyro's find_valid_initial_params routine (called by NUTS.init()) tries various parameter sets (starting with init_to_value, then potentially jittering or drawing from priors) to find starting points for the MCMC chains that yield a finite log-density.

The DynareModelWithLambdified.log_likelihood() function returns a large negative value (e.g., -1e10) if its internal call to model.solve() indicates the solution was invalid for the given parameters.

The problem is that for parameter values that find_valid_initial_params tries (which are passed as JAX tracers during this phase), the model.solve() method is consistently returning solution_valid = False. This happens even though model.solve() works perfectly for the concrete init_to_value parameters.

The failure point within model.solve() when inputs are fully traced JAX objects (DynamicJaxprTrace for all parameters, including fixed ones) is most likely the SDA solver (solve_quadratic_matrix_equation_jax). When the matrices A, B, C (outputs of the lambdified functions fed with traced parameters) are themselves complex JAX tracers, the SDA solver:

Might fail to compute initial E0, F0 (if Bbar_reg becomes a singular tracer).

Might encounter numerical instability during its lax.scan iterations (e.g., M1 or M2 becoming singular tracers, or internal states becoming NaN/Inf tracers).

This results in the SDA solver's converged_flag (which is final_state.converged & final_state.is_valid) evaluating to False when traced.

This, in turn, causes valid_stat_solve in model.solve() to be False, leading to solution_valid_final being False, and thus log_likelihood returning -1e10.

Key Log Evidence Supporting This:

The debug prints show this sequence during MCMC initialization attempts:

The first call to log_likelihood (likely with concrete primals of init_to_value) works:

[LogLik ValidityCheck] ... is_valid_for_cond=True

[LogLik End] Final log_prob returned: 606.611...

Subsequent calls to log_likelihood by Numpyro's init (where parameters are fully traced DynamicJaxprTrace):

[LogLik ValidityCheck] ... is_valid_for_cond=True (The outer lax.cond still proceeds because the first solve with concrete primals was fine).

Inside _calculate_likelihood, the inner self.solve(pd_operand) is called with fully traced pd_operand.

The debug prints for this inner solve show:

[solve() validity details] valid_stat_solve (tracer): Traced<ShapedArray(bool[])>...

[solve() validity details] solution_valid_final_JAX_BOOL (tracer): Traced<ShapedArray(bool[])>...

Crucially, this traced solution_valid_final_JAX_BOOL from the inner solve must be evaluating to False for the parameters Numpyro is trying.

This causes the inner lax.cond (within _calculate_likelihood) to select its "invalid" branch, making _calculate_likelihood return -1e10.

Since all attempts by find_valid_initial_params hit this -1e10, it gives up.

Relevant Files & Functions:

run_estimation.py:

DynareModelWithLambdified.solve(): Contains logic for evaluating lambdified functions, calling SDA, computing Q, and determining overall solution validity. Its interaction with traced parameters is key.

DynareModelWithLambdified.log_likelihood(): Contains the lax.cond structure and calls solve().

numpyro_model_fixed(): Defines the Numpyro model, calls log_likelihood.

MCMC setup and init_strategy.

dynare_parser_engine.py:

parse_lambdify_and_order_model(): Generates the lambdified functions for A,B,C,D. The JAX code produced by sympy.lambdify might have subtle behaviors with fully traced inputs.

solve_quadratic_matrix_equation_jax(): The JAX SDA solver. Its numerical stability and convergence properties when all its matrix inputs (A,B,C) and internal states are JAX tracers is the primary suspect.

Kalman_filter_jax.py: Less likely to be the source of the "Cannot find valid initial parameters" error now that the direct test and the first log-likelihood call pass, but its robustness is still important for the actual MCMC sampling.

Next Steps for Tomorrow:

Confirm SDA is the Culprit with Traced Inputs:

The highest priority is to get more insight into why solve_quadratic_matrix_equation_jax returns converged_flag = False when its inputs A, B, C are tracers derived from Numpyro's parameter exploration.

This involves adding jax.debug.print statements inside sda_scan_body in solve_quadratic_matrix_equation_jax (in dynare_parser_engine.py) to monitor current_rel_diff, converged_this_step, current_step_valid, next_is_valid, and next_converged when parameters are tracers.

To trigger these debug prints only during the problematic traced calls, you might need to pass a (concrete) boolean sda_debug_prints flag down through model.solve() into solve_quadratic_matrix_equation_jax.

If SDA is confirmed unstable with tracers:

Review SDA Logic: Scrutinize every operation in sda_scan_body for potential issues with abstract/traced inputs (e.g., divisions by traced values that could be zero, matrix inversions of traced singular matrices).

Increase Jitter/Regularization in SDA: Experiment with slightly larger _SDA_JITTER or more aggressive regularization of matrices like M1, M2, Bbar_reg when inputs are known to be tracers (this is hard to do conditionally without more flags).

Alternative Solvers (More involved): Consider if a different type of matrix equation solver might be more robust to traced inputs for your specific model structure, though the SDA is standard.

SymPy Lambdify Output: As a deeper dive, inspect the JAX code generated by sympy.lambdify for the A,B,C functions. Are there any unusual constructs that might behave poorly with JAX tracers?

Constrain Priors Further (if specific problematic regions identified): If the debug prints from (1) show that the SDA fails only when certain parameters (e.g., sigma_... very close to zero, or rho_... very close to 1) are hit, then making the priors avoid these extreme regions more strongly could be a pragmatic (though less ideal) solution.

The core challenge is ensuring that the entire computation graph from parameter inputs to the final log-likelihood is robust not just for concrete values but also when JAX traces it with abstract values or DynamicJaxprTrace objects.
